# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Sandpass repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Sandstorm employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Sandstorm holds the copyright.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# copyright belongs to the individual or the corporation.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>

# Please keep the list sorted.
